# MySensorApp demonstrates two sensors: 
1. The step counter display. A reset button is provided.  
2. The accelerometer data display.  A toast message "crash" is trigger when it exceeds a big number (5 times gravity). 
A more sophiscated car crash alert may be derived from signals of multiple sensors.
